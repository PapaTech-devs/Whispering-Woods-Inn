          you. It functions as your identification card, recording such things
          as Internet addresses, passwords, and preferences. When you visit the
          website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser.
          It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. With most Internet
          browsers, you can erase "cookies" from your computer hard drive, block
          all "cookies," or receive a warning before a "cookie" is stored.

          collected from you primarily to fulfill your hotel reservation. Prior
          to your stay, this may include sending your information to the Hotel
          or sending you pre-stay communications. Following your stay, we may
          also send you post-stay communications and satisfaction surveys to get

          to comply with our privacy requirements before we provide them with
          information. Aside from the purposes described above, we do not share
          your stay information with any other third parties unless we have your
          consent or under special circumstances, such as:
        </p>

          participate in one of our other services. In these instances, we will

          to participate in. The information collected may include personal
          details such as your name, address, and contact information, as well
